                        text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document
                        or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by
                        the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition
                        or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or
                        comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually
                        has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to
                        latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of
                        European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.</p>
